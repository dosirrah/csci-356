"""
**Problem 7**: (2 points) Write a program that compares the performance of the
`del` operator on lists and dictionaries.  The main program should plot
the run time of each on the same plot as a function of n.  Also plot
functions that bound the time complexity and print out what you think
is the time complexity of `del` operators for lists and dictionaries
using big-O notation.  When measuring performance on the list `del`
operator, be sure to delete items at random locations from the list.
