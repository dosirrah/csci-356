6. In the definition of fractions we assumed that negative fractions have a negative numerator and a
positive denominator. Using a negative denominator would cause some of the relational operators to
give incorrect results. In general, this is an unnecessary constraint. Modify the constructor to allow
the user to pass a negative denominator so that all of the operators continue to work properly.
